        <div class="s1"><p>Elden Ring is an action role-playing game set in third-person perspective
            . It includes elements that are similar to those in other FromSoftware-developed games,
             such as the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. 
             The game is set in an open world; players can freely explore the Lands Between and its six main areas,
              which include Limgrave—an area of grassy plains and ancient ruins—and Caelid,
               a wasteland that is home to undead monsters.
                The open world is explored using the character's mount Torrent as the main mode of transportation,
                 though players may use fast travel outside combat. Throughout the game, players encounter non-player characters 
                 (NPCs) and enemies, including demigods who rule each main area and serve as the game's main bosses.
                  Aside from the main areas, Elden Ring has hidden dungeons, catacombs, tunnels, and caves where players can fight 
                  bosses and gather helpful items

            At the game's start, the player chooses a character class, which determines their starting spells, equipment, and attributes. Combat with enemies can be within melee, or from a distance using ranged weapons. Enemy attacks can be dodged or blocked using shields. Spells allow players to enhance their weapons, fight enemies from afar, and restore lost hit points. The player can memorize a limited amount of these spells, which can be cast using a staff or sacred seal item.[6][7] Weapons can be improved using ashes of war, which are obtainable "enchantments" that grant weapons new capabilities. Ashes of war can be applied to or removed from weapons, and each Ash adds a weapon art, a special ability that can be used during combat.[8] Aside from direct combat, stealth mechanics can be used to avoid enemies or allow the targeting of foes with critical hits while hidden.[9][10] Staggering enemies and parrying their attacks can also create opportunities for critical hits.[11][12]

        <div class="sss">The full Elden Ring map is split into roughly 10 main areas. Though the game can be completed without visiting them all, it is worth taking the time to explore as it will yield Smithing Stones and other valuable upgrades, like Golden Seeds and Sacred Tear</div>
       </div>
       <div class="ssss">In the Lands Between ruled by Queen Marika the Eternal,
        the Elden Ring, the source of the Erdtree, has been shattered.
        
        Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring known as the Great Runes,
        and the mad taint of their newfound strength triggered a war: The Shattering.
        
        A war that meant abandonment by the Greater Will.
        
        And now the guidance of grace will be brought to the Tarnished
        who were spurned by the grace of gold and exiled from the Lands Between.
        
        Ye dead who yet live, your grace long lost,
        follow the path to the Lands Between beyond the foggy sea
        to stand before the Elden Ring.
        
        And become the Elden Lord.</div>
