                <div>Kevin is a music-loving thrill seeker who knows how to throw a party, and he’s the Saints publicist and fixer. He’s a notorious Santo Ileso DJ with connections all over town, which makes him the guy who knows the guy who knows the guy; if you need something, Kevin knows who can get it for you. He loves people, is super loyal to his friends, and would do anything for them. He’s also a great cook… and, given his connection to the Idols, he’s got no qualms at all about breaking eggs to make his omelets.</div>

                <div>Neenah is the Saints’ getaway driver—the best in the business—and has a long association with Los Panteros. She has had a deep-seated love of cars all her life and knows them inside out. But more than just a gear-head, she also loves art. Whether it comes to fixing engines, building sculptures, or running contraband, Neenah is a natural at getting her hands dirty. Calm and cool-headed, there’s no one better to have at your back in a tight spot..</div>

                <div>Eli is the long-term strategic thinker of the Saints, the one who knows how to take them from small time operators to a big time organization. A business mastermind, Eli is driven and determined to build an empire. He came to Santo Ileso to make his fortune as an entrepreneur, to start a business for himself. He just didn’t realize that his startup was going to be a criminal empire.</div>

                <div>The Boss is the heart of the Saints, the glue that holds the crew together. They are also the ultimate murder machine. They shoot first and ask later. Cocky, confident, and not built for following orders, the Boss is ultimately you – you get to decide who you want to be and what you want to do, to become Self Made and form the new Saints.</div>
